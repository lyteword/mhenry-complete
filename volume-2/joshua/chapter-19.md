# Chapter 19

In the description of the lots of Judah and Benjamin we have an account both of the borders that surrounded them and of the cities contained in them. In that of Ephraim and Manasseh we have the borders, but not the cities; in this chapter Simeon and Dan are described by their cities only, and not their borders, because they lay very much within Judah, especially the former; the rest have both their borders described and their cities names, especially frontiers. Here is, I. The lot of Simeon, Jos 19:1-9. II. Of Zebulun, Jos 19:10-16. III. Of Issachar, Jos 19:17-23. IV. Of Asher, Jos 19:24-31. V. Of Naphtali, Jos 19:32-39. VI. Of Dan, Jos 19:40-48. Lastly, The inheritance assigned to Joshua himself and his own family, Jos 19:49-51.

## The Lot of Simeon. (b. c. 1444.)

> <sup>1</sup> And the second lot came forth to Simeon, *even* for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.  
> <sup>2</sup> And they had in their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,  
> <sup>3</sup> And Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Azem,  
> <sup>4</sup> And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,  
> <sup>5</sup> And Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,  
> <sup>6</sup> And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:  
> <sup>7</sup> Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:  
> <sup>8</sup> And all the villages that *were* round about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramath of the south. This *is* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.  
> <sup>9</sup> Out of the portion of the children of Judah *was* the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.  

Simeon's lot was drawn after Judah's, Joseph's, and Benjamin's, because Jacob had put that tribe under disgrace; yet it is put before the two younger sons of Leah and the three sons of the handmaids. Not one person of note, neither judge nor prophet, was of this tribe, that we know of.

I\. The situation of their lot was within that of Judah (Jos 19:1) and was taken from it, Jos 19:9. It seems, those that first surveyed the land thought it larger than it was, and that it would have held out to give every tribe in proportion as large a share as they had carved out for Judah; but, upon a more strict enquiry, it was found that it would not reach (Jos 19:9): *The part of the children of Judah was too much for them,* more than they needed, and more, as it proved, than fell to their share. Yet God did not by the lot lessen it, but left it to their prudence and care afterwards to discover and rectify the mistake, which when they did, 1. The men of Judah did not oppose the taking away of the cities again, which by the first distribution fell within their border, when they were convinced that they had more than their proportion. In all such cases errors must be excepted and a review admitted if there be occasion. Though, in strictness, what fell to their lot was their right against all the world, yet they would not insist upon it when it appeared that another tribe would want what they had to spare. Note, We must look on the things of others, and not on our own only. The abundance of some must supply the wants of others, that there may be somewhat of an equality, for which there may be equity where there is not law. 2. That which was thus taken off from Judah to be put into a new lot Providence directed to the tribe of Simeon, that Jacob's prophecy concerning this tribe might be fulfilled, *I will divide them in Jacob.* The cities of Simeon were scattered in Judah, with which tribe they were surrounded, except on that side towards the sea. This brought them into a confederacy with the tribe of Judah (Jdg 1:3), and afterwards was a happy occasion of the adherence of many of this tribe to the house of David, at the time of the revolt of the ten tribes to Jeroboam. 2Ch 15:9, *out of Simeon they fell to* Asa *in abundance.* It is good being in a good neighbourhood.

II\. The cities within their lot are here named. Beersheba, or Sheba, for these names seem to refer to the same place, is put first. Ziklag, which we read of in David's story, is one of them. What course they took to enlarge their borders and make room for themselves we find 1Ch 4:39-43, etc.

## The Lot of Zebulun. (b. c. 1444.)

> <sup>10</sup> And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:  
> <sup>11</sup> And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that *is* before Jokneam;  
> <sup>12</sup> And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,  
> <sup>13</sup> And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goeth out to Remmon-methoar to Neah;  
> <sup>14</sup> And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthah-el:  
> <sup>15</sup> And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Beth-lehem: twelve cities with their villages.  
> <sup>16</sup> This *is* the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.  

This is the lot of Zebulun, who, though born of Leah after Issachar, yet was blessed by Jacob and Moses before him; and therefore it was so ordered that his lot was drawn before that of Issachar, north of which it lay and south of Asher. 1. The lot of this tribe was washed by the great sea on the west, and by the sea of Tiberias on the east, answering Jacob's prophecy (Ge 49:13), *Zebulun shall be a haven of ships,* trading ships on the great sea and fishing ships on the sea of Galilee. 2. Though there were some places in this tribe which were made famous in the Old Testament, especially *Mount Carmel,* on which the famous trial was between God and Baal in Elijah's time, yet it was made much more illustrious in the New Testament; for within the lot of this tribe was Nazareth, where our blessed Saviour spent so much of his time on earth, and from which he was called *Jesus of Nazareth,* and *Mount Tabor* on which he was transfigured, and that coast of the sea of Galilee on which Christ preached so many sermons and wrought so many miracles.

## The Lot of Issachar. (b. c. 1444.)

> <sup>17</sup> *And* the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.  
> <sup>18</sup> And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,  
> <sup>19</sup> And Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,  
> <sup>20</sup> And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,  
> <sup>21</sup> And Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez;  
> <sup>22</sup> And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Beth-shemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.  
> <sup>23</sup> This *is* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.  

The lot of Issachar ran from Jordan in the east to the great sea in the west, Manasseh on the south, and Zebulun on the north. A numerous tribe, Nu 26:25. Tola, one of the judges, was of this tribe, Jdg 10:1. So was Baasha, one of the kings of Israel, 1Ki 15:27. The most considerable places in this tribe were, 1. Jezreel, in which was Ahab's palace, and near it Naboth's vineyard. 2. Shunem, where lived that good Shunamite that entertained Elisha. 3. The river Kishon, on the banks of which, in this tribe, Sisera was beaten by Deborah and Barak. 4. The mountains of Gilboa, on which Saul and Jonathan were slain, which were not far from Endor, where Saul consulted the witch. 5. The valley of Megiddo, where Josiah was slain near Hadad-rimmon, 2Ki 23:29, Zec 12:11.

## The Lot of Asher. (b. c. 1444.)

> <sup>24</sup> And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.  
> <sup>25</sup> And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,  
> <sup>26</sup> And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;  
> <sup>27</sup> And turneth toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthah-el toward the north side of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,  
> <sup>28</sup> And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, *even* unto great Zidon;  
> <sup>29</sup> And *then* the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:  
> <sup>30</sup> Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.  
> <sup>31</sup> This *is* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.  

The lot of Asher lay upon the coast of the great sea. We read not of any famous person of this tribe but Anna the prophetess, who was a constant resident in the temple at the time of our Saviour's birth, Lu 2:36. Nor were there many famous places in this tribe. Aphek (mentioned Jos 19:30) was the place near which Benhadad was beaten by Ahad, 1Ki 20:30. But close adjoining to this tribe were the celebrated sea-port towns of Tyre and Sidon, which we read so much of. Tyre is called here *that strong city* (Jos 19:29), but Bishop Patrick thinks it was not the same Tyre that we read of afterwards, for that was built on an island; this old strong city was on the continent. And it is conjectured by some that into these two strong-holds, Sidon and Tzor, or Tyre, many of the people of Canaan fled and took shelter when Joshua invaded them.

## The Lot of Naphtali. (b. c. 1444.)

> <sup>32</sup> The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, *even* for the children of Naphtali according to their families.  
> <sup>33</sup> And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:  
> <sup>34</sup> And *then* the coast turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.  
> <sup>35</sup> And the fenced cities *are* Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,  
> <sup>36</sup> And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,  
> <sup>37</sup> And Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,  
> <sup>38</sup> And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.  
> <sup>39</sup> This *is* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.  

Naphtali lay furthest north of all the tribes, bordering on Mount Libanus. The city of Leshem, or Liash, lay on the utmost edge of it to the north, and therefore when the Danites had made themselves masters of it, and called it *Dan,* the length of Canaan from north to south was reckoned from Dan to Beersheba. It had Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah upon Jordan, probably a city of that name, and so distinguished from the tribe of Judah on the east. It was in the lot of this tribe, near the waters of Merom, that Joshua fought and routed Jabin, Jos 11:1-14. etc. In this tribe stood Capernaum and Bethsaida, on the north end of the sea of Tiberias, in which Christ did so many mighty works; and the mountain (as is supposed) on which Christ preached, Mt 5:1.

## The Lot of Dan. (b. c. 1444.)

> <sup>40</sup> *And* the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.  
> <sup>41</sup> And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,  
> <sup>42</sup> And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,  
> <sup>43</sup> And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,  
> <sup>44</sup> And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,  
> <sup>45</sup> And Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,  
> <sup>46</sup> And Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.  
> <sup>47</sup> And the coast of the children of Dan went out *too little* for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.  
> <sup>48</sup> This *is* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.  

Dan, though commander of one of the four squadrons of the camp of Israel, in the wilderness, that which brought up the rear, yet was last provided for in Canaan, and his lot fell in the southern part of Canaan, between Judah on the east and the land of the Philistines on the west, Ephraim on the north and Simeon on the south. Providence ordered this numerous and powerful tribe into a post of danger, as best able to deal with those vexatious neighbours the Philistines, and so it was found in Samson. Here is an account, 1. Of what fell to this tribe by lot, Zorah, and Eshtaol, and the camp of Dan thereabouts, of which we read in the story of Samson. And near there was the valley of Eshcol, whence the spies brought the famous bunch of grapes. Japho, or Joppa was in this lot. 2. Of what they got by their own industry and valour, which is mentioned here (Jos 19:47), but related at large, Jdg 18:7-31, etc.

## The Inheritance of Joshua. (b. c. 1444.)

> <sup>49</sup> When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:  
> <sup>50</sup> According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, *even* Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.  
> <sup>51</sup> These *are* the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.  

Before this account of the dividing of the land is solemnly closed up, in the Jos 19:51, which intimates that the thing was done to the satisfaction of all, here is an account of the particular inheritance assigned to Joshua. 1. He was last served, though the eldest and greatest man of all Israel, and who, having commanded in the conquest of Canaan, might have demanded the first settlement in it for himself and his family. But he would make it to appear that in all he did he sought the good of his country, and not any private interest of his own. He was content to be unfixed till he saw them all settled; and herein is a great example to all in public places to prefer the common welfare before their particular satisfaction. Let the public be first served. 2. He had his lot *according to the word of the Lord.* It is probable that, when God by Moses told Caleb what inheritance he should have (Jos 14:9), he gave the like promise to Joshua, which he had an eye to in making his election: this made his portion doubly pleasant, that he had it, not as the rest by common providence, but by special promise. 3. He chose it in Mount Ephraim, which belonged to his own tribe, with which he thereby put himself in common, when he might by prerogative have chosen his inheritance in some other tribe, as suppose that of Judah, and thereby have distinguished himself from them. Let no man's preferment or honour make him ashamed of his family or country, or estrange him from it. The tabernacle was set up in the lot of Ephraim, and Joshua would forecast not to be far from that. 4. The *children of Israel* are said to *give it to him* (Jos 19:49), which bespeaks his humility, that he would not take it to himself without the people's consent and approbation, as if he would thereby own himself, though *major singulis—greater than any one,* yet *minor universis—less than the whole assemblage,* and would hold even the estate of his family, under God, by the grant of the people. 5. It was a city that must be built before it was fit to be dwelt in. While others dwelt in houses which they built not, Joshua must erect for himself (that he might be a pattern of industry and contentment with mean things) such buildings as he could hastily run up, without curiosity or magnificence. Our Lord Jesus thus came and dwelt among us, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for us, yet himself not having where to lay his head. *Even Christ pleased not himself.*
