# 1 Chronicles 14 

In this chapter we have, I. David's kingdom established, 1Ch 14:1,2. II. His family built up, 1Ch 14:3-7. III. His enemies, the Philistines, routed in two campaigns, 1Ch 14:8-17. This is repeated here from 2Sa 5:11-25, etc.

## David's Kingdom Established (1045 BC)

> **¹** Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.  
> **²** And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.  
> **³** And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.  
> **⁴** Now these *are* the names of *his* children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,  
> **⁵** And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,  
> **⁶** And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,  
> **⁷** And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.  

We may observe here, 1. There is no man that has such a sufficiency in himself but he has need of his neighbours and has reason to be thankful for their help: David had a very large kingdom, Hiram a very little one; yet David could not build himself a house to his mind unless Hiram furnished him with both workmen and materials, 1Ch 14:1. This is a reason why we should despise none, but, as we have opportunity, be obliging to all. 2. It is a great satisfaction to a wise man to be settled, and to a good man to see the special providences of God in his settlement. The people had made David king; but he could not be easy, nor think himself happy, till he perceived that *the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel,* 1Ch 14:2. "Who shall unfix me if God hath fixed me?" 3. We must look upon all our advancements as designed for our usefulness. *David's kingdom was lifted up on high,* not for his own sake, that he might look great, but *because of his people Israel,* that he might be a guide and protector to them. We are blessed in order that we may be blessings. See Ge 12:2. We are not born, nor do we live, for ourselves. 4. It is difficult to thrive without growing secure and indulgent to the flesh. It was David's infirmity that when he settled in his kingdom *he took more wives* (1Ch 14:3), yet the numerous issue he had added to his honour and strength. Lo, *children are a heritage of the Lord.* We had an account of David's children, not only in Samuel, but in this book (1Ch 3:1-9, etc.) and now here again; for it was their honour to have such a father.

## The Defeat of the Philistines (1045 BC)

> **⁸** And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard *of it,* and went out against them.  
> **⁹** And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  
> **¹⁰** And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.  
> **¹¹** So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.  
> **¹²** And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.  
> **¹³** And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.  
> **¹⁴** Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.  
> **¹⁵** And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, *that* then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.  
> **¹⁶** David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.  
> **¹⁷** And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.  

This narrative of David's triumph over the Philistines is much the same with that, 2Sa 5:17-25, etc. 1. Let the attack which the Philistines made upon David forbid us to be secure in any settlement or advancement, and engage us to expect molestation in this world. When we are most easy something or other may come to be a terror or vexation to us. Christ's kingdom will thus be insulted by the serpent's seed, especially when it makes any advances. 2. Let David's enquiry of God, once and again, upon occasion of the Philistines' invading him, direct us in all our ways to acknowledge God—in distress to fly to him, when we are wronged to appeal to him, and, when we know not what to do, to ask counsel at his oracles, to put ourselves under his direction, and to beg of him to show us the right way. 3. Let David's success encourage us to resist our spiritual enemies, in observance of divine directions and dependence on divine strength. Resist the devil, and he shall flee as the Philistines did before David. 4. Let the sound of the going in the tops of the mulberry trees direct us to attend God's motions both in his providence and in the influences of his Spirit. When we perceive God to go before us let us gird up our loins, gird on our armour, and follow him. 5. Let David's burning the gods of the Philistines, when they fell into his hands, teach us a holy indignation against idolatry and all the remains of it. 6. Let David's thankful acknowledgment of the hand of God in his successes direct us to bring all our sacrifices of praise to God's altar. *Not unto us, O Lord! not unto us, but to thy name give glory.* 7. Let the reputation which David obtained, not only in his kingdom, but among his neighbours, be looked upon as a type and figure of the exalted honour of the Son of David (1Ch 14:17): *The fame of David went out into all lands;* he was generally talked of, and admired by all people, and *the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.* All looked upon him as a formidable enemy and a desirable ally. Thus has God highly exalted our Redeemer, and given him a name above every name.
