# Chapter 24

This chapter gives us a more particular account of the distribution of the priests and Levites into their respective classes, for the more regular discharge of the duties of their offices, according to their families. I. Of the priests, 1Ch 24:1-19. II. Of the Levites, 1Ch 24:20-31.

## The Courses of the Priests. (b. c. 1015.)

> **¹** Now *these are* the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  
> **²** But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.  
> **³** And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.  
> **⁴** And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and *thus* were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar *there were* sixteen chief men of the house of *their* fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.  
> **⁵** Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors *of the house* of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.  
> **⁶** And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, *one* of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and *before* the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and *one* taken for Ithamar.  
> **⁷** Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  
> **⁸** The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,  
> **⁹** The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,  
> **¹⁰** The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,  
> **¹¹** The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,  
> **¹²** The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,  
> **¹³** The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,  
> **¹⁴** The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,  
> **¹⁵** The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,  
> **¹⁶** The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,  
> **¹⁷** The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,  
> **¹⁸** The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.  
> **¹⁹** These *were* the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.  

The particular account of these establishments is of little use to us now; but, when Ezra published it, it was of great use to direct their church affairs after their return from captivity into the old channel again. The title of this record we have 1Ch 24:1—*These are the divisions of the sons of Aaron,* not by which they divided one from another, or were at variance one with another (it is a pity there should ever be any such divisions among the sons of Israel, but especially among the sons of Aaron), but the distribution of them in order to the dividing of their work among themselves; it was a division which God made, and was made for him. 1. This distribution was made for the more regular discharge of the duties of their office. God was, and still is, the God of order, and not of confusion, particularly in the things of his worship. Number without order is but a clog and an occasion of tumult; but when every one has, and knows, and keeps, his place and work, the more the better. In the mystical body, every member has its use, for the good of the whole, Ro 12:4,5,1Co 12:12. 2. It was made by lot, that the disposal thereof might be of the Lord, and so all quarrels and contentions might be prevented, and no man could be charged with partiality, nor could any say that they had wrong done them. As God is the God or order, so he is the God of peace. Solomon says of the lot that it *causeth contention to cease.* 3. The lot was cast publicly, and with great solemnity, in the presence of the king, princes, and priests, that there might be no room for any fraudulent practices or the suspicion of them. The lot is an appeal to God, and ought to be managed with corresponding reverence and sincerity. Matthias was chosen to the apostleship by lot, with prayer (Ac 1:24,26), and I know not but it might be still used in faith in parallel cases, as an instituted ordinance. We have here the name of the public notary that was employed in writing the names, and drawing the lots, (1Ch 24:6): *Shemaiah, one of the Levites.* 4. What those priests were chosen to was to preside in the affairs of the sanctuary (1Ch 24:5), in their several courses and turns. That which was to be determined by the lot was only the precedency, not who should serve (for they chose all the chief men), but who should serve first, and who next, that every one might know his course, and attend in it. Of the twenty-four chief men of the priests sixteen were of the house of Eleazar and eight of Ithamar; for the house of Ithamar may well be supposed to have dwindled since the sentence passed on the family of Eli, who was of that house. The method of drawing the lots is intimated (1Ch 24:6), one chief household being taken for Eleazar, and one for Ithamar. The sixteen chief names of Eleazar were put in one urn, the eight for Ithamar in another, and they drew out of them alternately, as long as those for Ithamar lasted, and then out of those only for Eleazar, or two for Eleazar, and then one for Ithamar, throughout. 5. Among these twenty-four courses the eighth is that of Abijah or Abia (1Ch 24:10), which is mentioned (Lu 1:5) as the course which Zechariah was of, the father of John the Baptist, by which it appears that these courses which David now settled, though interrupted perhaps in the bad reigns and long broken off by the captivity, yet continued in succession till the destruction of the second temple by the Romans. And each course was called by the name of him in whom it was first founded, as the high priest is here called *Aaron* (1Ch 24:19), because succeeding in his dignity and power, though we read not of any of them that bore that name. Whoever was high priest must be reverenced and observed by the inferior priests as their father, as Aaron their father. Christ is high priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection.

> **²⁰** And the rest of the sons of Levi *were these:* Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.  
> **²¹** Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first *was* Isshiah.  
> **²²** Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.  
> **²³** And the sons *of Hebron;* Jeriah *the first,* Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.  
> **²⁴** *Of* the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.  
> **²⁵** The brother of Michah *was* Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.  
> **²⁶** The sons of Merari *were* Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.  
> **²⁷** The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.  
> **²⁸** Of Mahli *came* Eleazar, who had no sons.  
> **²⁹** Concerning Kish: the son of Kish *was* Jerahmeel.  
> **³⁰** The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These *were* the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.  
> **³¹** These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.  

Most of the Levites here named were mentioned before, 1Ch 23:16-23, etc. They were of those who were to attend the priests in the service of the house of God. But they are here mentioned again as heads of the twenty-four courses of Levites (and about so many are here named), who were to attend the twenty-four courses of the priests: they are therefore said to *cast lots over against their brethren* (so they are called, not their *lords*), *the sons of Aaron,* who were not to lord it over God's *clergy,* as the original word is, 1Pe 5:3. And, that the whole disposal of the affair might be of the Lord, the principal fathers cast lots over against their younger brethren; that is, those that were of the elder house came upon he level with those of the younger families, and took their place, not by seniority, but as God by the lot directed. Note, In Christ no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if they be faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the principal fathers.
