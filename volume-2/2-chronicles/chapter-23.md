# Chapter 23

Six years bloody Athaliah had tyrannised; in this chapter we have her deposed and slain, and Joash, the rightful heir, enthroned. We had the story before nearly as it is here related, 2Ki 11:4-21, etc. I. Jehoiada prepared the people for the king, acquainted them with his design, armed them, and appointed them their posts, 2Ch 23:1-10. II. He produced the king to the people, crowned him, and anointed him, 2Ch 23:11. III. He slew the usurper, 2Ch 23:12-15. IV. He reformed the kingdom, re-established religion, and restored the civil government, 2Ch 23:16-21.

## Preparations to Restore Judah (878 BC)

> **¹** And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.  
> **²** And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.  
> **³** And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.  
> **⁴** This *is* the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, *shall be* porters of the doors;  
> **⁵** And a third part *shall be* at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people *shall be* in the courts of the house of the LORD.  
> **⁶** But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they *are* holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.  
> **⁷** And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever *else* cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.  
> **⁸** So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go *out* on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.  
> **⁹** Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that *had been* king David's, which *were* in the house of God.  
> **¹⁰** And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.  
> **¹¹** Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and *gave him* the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.  

We may well imagine the bad posture of affairs in Jerusalem during Athaliah's six years' usurpation, and may wonder that God permitted it and his people bore it so long; but after such a dark and tedious night the returning day in this revolution was the brighter and the more welcome. The continuance of David's seed and throne was what God had sworn by his holiness (Ps 89:35), and an interruption was no defeasance; the stream of government here runs again in the right channel. The instrument and chief manager of the restoration is Jehoiada, who appears to have been, 1. A man of great prudence, who reserved the young prince for so many years till he was fit to appear in public, and till the nation had grown weary of the usurper, who prepared his work beforehand, and then effected it with admirable secresy and expedition. When God has work to do he will qualify and animate men for it. 2. A man of great interest. The captains joined with him, 2Ch 23:1. The Levites and the chief of the fathers of Israel came at his call to Jerusalem (2Ch 23:2) and were there ready to receive his orders. See what a command wisdom and virtue will give men. *The Levites and all Judah did as Jehoiada commanded* (2Ch 23:8), and, which is strange, all that were entrusted with the secret kept their own counsel till it was executed. Thus *the words of the wise are heard in quiet,* Ec 9:17. 3. A man of great faith. It was not only common equity (much less his wife's relation to the royal family) that put him upon this undertaking, but a regard to the word of God, and the divine entail of the crown (2Ch 23:3): *The king's son shall reign,* must reign, *as the Lord hath said.* His eye to the promise, and dependence upon that, added a great deal of glory to this undertaking. 4. A man of great religion. This matter was to be done in the temple, which might occasion some breach of rule, and the necessity of the case might be thought to excuse it; but he gave special order that none of the people should come into the house of the Lord, but the priests and Levites only, who were holy, upon pain of death, 2Ch 23:6,7. Never let sacred things be profaned, no, not for the support of civil rights. 5. A man of great resolution. When he had undertaken this business he went through with it, *brought out the king, crowned him, and gave him the testimony,* 2Ch 23:11. He ventured his head, but it was in a good cause, and therefore he went on boldly. It is here said that his sons joined with him in anointing the young king. One of them, it is likely, was that Zechariah whom Joash afterwards put to death for reproving him (2Ch 24:20), which was so much the more ungrateful because he bore a willing part in anointing him.

## Joash Crowned and Athaliah Slain (878 BC)

> **¹²** Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:  
> **¹³** And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.  
> **¹⁴** Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.  
> **¹⁵** So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.  
> **¹⁶** And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.  
> **¹⁷** Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.  
> **¹⁸** Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as *it is* written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, *as it was ordained* by David.  
> **¹⁹** And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none *which was* unclean in any thing should enter in.  
> **²⁰** And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.  
> **²¹** And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.  

Here we have, I. The people pleased, 2Ch 23:12,13. When the king stood at his pillar, whose right it was to stand there, *all the people of the land rejoiced to see a rod sprung out of the stem of Jesse,* Isa 11:1. When it seemed a withered root in a dry ground, to see what they despaired of ever seeing—a king of the house of David, what a pleasing surprise was it to them! They ran in transports of joy to see this sight, praised the king, and praised God, for they had with them such as *taught to sing praise.*

II\. Athaliah slain. She ran upon the point of the sword of justice; for, imagining her interest much better than it was, she ventured *into the house of the Lord* at that time, and cried, *Treason, treason!* But nobody seconded her, or sided with her. The pride of her heart deceived her. She thought all her own, whereas none were cordially so. Jehoiada, as protector in the king's minority, ordered her to be slain (2Ch 23:14), which was done immediately (2Ch 23:15), only care was taken that she should not be *slain in the house of the Lord,* that sacred place must not be so far disgraced, nor that wicked woman so far honoured.

III\. The original contract agreed to, 2Ch 23:16. In the *Kings* it is said that Jehoiada made a covenant between the *Lord,* the people, and the king, 2Ki 11:17. Here it is said to be between *himself,* the people, and the king; for he, as God's priest, was his representative in this transaction, or a sort of mediator, as Moses was. The indenture was tripartite, but the true intent and meaning of the whole was that *they should be the Lord's people.* God covenanted by Jehoiada to take them for his people; the king and people covenanted with him to be his; and then the king covenanted with the people to govern them *as the people of God,* and the people with the king to be subject to him *as the Lord's people,* in his fear and for his sake. Let us look upon ourselves and one another as *the Lord's people,* and this will have a powerful influence upon us in the discharge of all our duty both to God and man.

IV\. Baal destroyed, 2Ch 23:17. They would not have done half their work if they had only destroyed the usurper of the *king's* right, and not the usurper of *God's* right—if they had asserted the honour of the throne, and not that of the altar. The greatest grievance of Athaliah's reign was the bringing in of the worship of Baal, and supporting of that; therefore that must be abolished in the first place. Down with Baal's house, his altars, his images; down with them all, and let the blood of his priests be mingled with his sacrifices; for God had commanded that seducers to idolatry should be put to death, De 13:5,6.

V\. The temple service revived, 2Ch 23:18,19. This had been neglected in the last reigns, the priest and people wanting either power or zeal to keep it up when they had princes that were disaffected to it. But Jehoiada restored *the offices of the house of the Lord,* which in the late times had been disturbed and invaded, to the proper course and proper hands. 1. He appointed the priests to their courses, for the due offering of sacrifices, according to the law of Moses. 2. The singers to theirs, according to the appointment of David. The sacrifices (it should seem) were *offered with rejoicing and singing,* and with good reason. We *joy in God* when we *receive the atonement,* Ro 5:11. 3. The porters were put in their respective posts as David ordered (2Ch 23:19), and their office was to take care that none who were upon any account ceremonially unclean should be admitted into the courts of the temple.

VI\. The civil government re-established, 2Ch 23:20. They brought the king in state to his own palace, and set him *upon the throne of the kingdom,* to give law, and give judgment, either in his own person or by Jehoiada his tutor. Thus was this happy revolution perfected. The generality of the people rejoiced in it, and the rest were quiet and made no opposition, 2Ch 23:21. When the Son of David is enthroned in the soul all is quiet and springs of joy are opened.
