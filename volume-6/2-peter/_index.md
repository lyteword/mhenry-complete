## Introduction

The penman of this epistle appears plainly to be the same who wrote the foregoing; and, whatever difference some learned men apprehend they discern in the style of this epistle from that of the former, this cannot be a sufficient argument to assert that it was written by Simon who succeeded the apostle James in the church at Jerusalem, inasmuch as he who wrote this epistle calls himself *Simon Peter, and an apostle* (2Pe 1:1), and says that he was *one of the three apostles that were present at Christ's transfiguration* (2Pe 1:18), and says expressly *that he had written a former epistle to them,* 2Pe 3:1. The design of this second epistle is the same with that of the former, as is evident from the 2Pe 3:1, whence observe that, in the things of God, we have need of *precept upon precept, and line upon line,* and all little enough to keep them in remembrance; and yet these are the things which should be most faithfully recorded and frequently remembered by us.
